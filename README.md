    About stdlib...
  </summary>
  <p>We believe in a future in which the web is a preferred environment for numerical computation. To help realize this future, we've built stdlib. stdlib is a standard library, with an emphasis on numerical and scientific computation, written in JavaScript (and C) for execution in browsers and in Node.js.</p>
  <p>The library is fully decomposable, being architected in such a way that you can swap out and mix and match APIs and functionality to cater to your exact preferences and use cases.</p>
  <p>When you use stdlib, you can be absolutely certain that you are using the most thorough, rigorous, well-written, studied, documented, tested, measured, and high-quality code out there.</p>
  <p>To join us in bringing numerical computing to the web, get started by checking us out on <a href="https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib">GitHub</a>, and please consider <a href="https://opencollective.com/stdlib">financially supporting stdlib</a>. We greatly appreciate your continued support!</p>

## Usage

To use in Observable,

```javascript
rffti = require( 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/fft-base-fftpack-rffti@umd/browser.js' )
```

To vendor stdlib functionality and avoid installing dependency trees for Node.js, you can use the UMD server build:

```javascript
var rffti = require( 'path/to/vendor/umd/fft-base-fftpack-rffti/index.js' )
```

To include the bundle in a webpage,

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/fft-base-fftpack-rffti@umd/browser.js"></script>
```

If no recognized module system is present, access bundle contents via the global scope:

```html
<script type="text/javascript">
(function () {
    window.rffti;
})();
</script>
```

#### rffti( N, workspace, strideW, offsetW )

Initializes a workspace array for performing a real-valued Fourier transform.

```javascript
var Float64Array = require( '@stdlib/array-float64' );

var N = 8;
var workspace = new Float64Array( ( 2*N ) + 34 );

var out = rffti( N, workspace, 1, 0 );
// returns <Float64Array>

var bool = ( out === workspace );
// returns true

var twiddleFactors = workspace.slice( N, 2*N );
// returns <Float64Array>[ 0, ~0.707, ~0.707, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ]

var factors = workspace.slice( 2*N, ( 2*N ) + 4 );
// returns <Float64Array>[ 8, 2, 2, 4 ]
```

The function accepts the following arguments:

-   **N**: length of the sequence to transform.
-   **workspace**: workspace array.
-   **strideW**: stride length for `workspace`.
-   **offsetW**: starting index for `workspace`.

<section class="notes">

## Notes

-   The workspace array is divided into three sections:

    ```text
              size = N                 N            2+ceil(log2(N)/2)
                   ↓                   ↓                  ↓
        | scratch / workspace | twiddle factors | radix factor table |
                   ↑                   ↑                  ↑
    i = 0         ...         N       ...       2N       ...
    ```

    -   **scratch/workspace**: used as a scratch space when performing transforms. This section is not updated during initialization.
    -   **twiddle factors**: a table of reusable complex-exponential constants stored as cosine/sine pairs.
    -   **radix factor table**: a table containing the sequence length `N`, the number of factors into which `N` was decomposed, and the individual integer radix factors.

-   In general, a workspace array should have `2N + 34` indexed elements (as `log2(N)/2 ≤ 32` for all `2^64`). During initialization, only the sections for storing twiddle factors and the factorization of `N` are updated.

-   The radix factor table is comprised as follows:

    ```text
    | sequence_length | number_of_factors | integer_factors |
    ```

-   If `N` equals `1`, the function returns early without modifying the workspace, as a single data point is its own Fourier transform.
